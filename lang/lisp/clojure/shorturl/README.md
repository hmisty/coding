# shorturl

An example [clojure][1] app supporting both lein and maven to package to both jar and war. 

lein is fun, and maven is for old fashion buddies :-D

Coding with eclipse juno + counterclockwise, that's why the project is structured as is.

## Usage

### package a war

By lein:

```bash
lein ring uberwar
```

tested with lein 2 + tomcat 7.

By maven:
```bash
mvn package
```

tested with maven 3 + tomcat 7.

### package a standalone jar

By lein:

	lein uberjar

tested with lein 2.

## FAQ

### duplicate entry when lein uberjar?

rm -rf target (mvn clean) and try again
