# Quick reference to Python in a single script (and notebook)

src: reference.py
from: https://www.dataschool.io/python-quick-reference/

Below is the reference guide to Python that I wish had existed when I was learning the language.

Here's what I want in a reference guide:

    High-quality examples that show the simplest possible usage of a given feature
    Explanatory comments, and descriptive variable names that eliminate the need for some comments
    Presented as a single script (or notebook), so that I can keep it open and search it when needed
    Code that can be run from top to bottom, with the relevant objects defined nearby

This is not written as a full-fledged Python tutorial, though I ordered the topics such that you can read it like a tutorial (i.e., each topic depends only on material preceding it).

The guide was written using Python 2 but is fully compatible with Python 3. Relevant differences between Python 2 and 3 are noted throughout the guide.
